def find_figure(start_doc, num_subplots):
    '''Determines where the figure should be plotted and returns the figure and
    axes references.
    This section checks to see if a current figure exists that the plots can be
    added too, and if not creates the figure to be plotted on. It is designed
    to be used in all of the plotting related callback_factories.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start_doc : dict
        the start document issued by the `Run_Engine` when starting a new 'run'
    num_subplots : int
        the number of axes pairs to return (i.e. the num of subplots required)

    Returns
    -------
    fig : matplotlib fig reference
        the reference to the figure we should use to plot.
    axes : list
        list of matplotlib axes references.

    # a lot of similar code being employed in each of the figure based
    # callback_factories. In addition most of this will probably end up living
    # on the databrowser what do people think?

    # For now this will always return a new `matplotlib.pyplot.figure` and
    # `matplotlib.pyplot.axes` object.
